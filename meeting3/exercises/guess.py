# Exercise
# Write a Python function guess_the_number(target) that implements a simple number-guessing game. The function should:
#
# Take an integer target (the number to guess) as input.
# Continuously prompt the user to enter a guess using input().
# Provide feedback for each guess:
# If the guess is too high, print "Too high!".
# If the guess is too low, print "Too low!".
# If the guess is correct, print "Correct!" and stop the loop.
# The function should ensure the user only enters integers, prompting them again if they enter invalid input.


# Example
# guess_the_number(42)
# Output:
# Enter your guess: 50
# Too high!
# Enter your guess: 30
# Too low!
# Enter your guess: 42
# Correct!
