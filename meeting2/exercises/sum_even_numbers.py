# Exercise: Sum of Even Numbers
# Write a function sum_even_numbers that takes a range of integers (using range)
# and returns the sum of all even numbers in that range.

# Input:
# Two integers, start and end, where start is the starting number and end is the ending number (inclusive).
# Task:
# Use a for loop with range to iterate through the numbers from start to end (inclusive).
# Check if a number is even (i.e., divisible by 2).
# Add all even numbers to a running total.
# Return the total sum of even numbers in the given range.

# Example input:
# sum_even_numbers(1, 10)  # output: 30

# Hints:
# Use the range function to generate numbers from start to end (inclusive).
# Use the modulo operator (%) to check if a number is even.
# The range(start, end+1) will generate a range from start to end, inclusive of end.
