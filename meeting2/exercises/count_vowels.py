# Exercise:
# Write a function count_vowels that takes a single string as an argument
# and returns the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the string.
# It should be case-insensitive, so both uppercase and lowercase vowels should be counted.

# Usage:
# text = "Hello World"
# print(count_vowels(text))  # Output: 3
