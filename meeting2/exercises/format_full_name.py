# Exercise:
# Write a function format_full_name that takes two arguments, first_name and last_name,
# and returns a formatted full name. The function should:
#
# Capitalize the first letter of each name and make the rest lowercase.
# Handle cases where either first_name or last_name is missing by
# returning only the name that is provided (or an empty string if both are missing).

# Usage
# print(format_full_name("jOhN", "DOE"))  # Output: "John Doe"
# print(format_full_name("ALICE", ""))    # Output: "Alice"
# print(format_full_name("", "SMITH"))    # Output: "Smith"
# print(format_full_name("", ""))         # Output: ""
